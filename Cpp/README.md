### C++ code for parse tree generation
A backtracking based code performs the similar task of syntax analysis as Yacc. We try to replicate the internal backtracking algorithm. The code takes as input the query, and checks for syntax errors. It prints the Parse tree for each query if it is entered correctly.


To execute the code:
```
$ g++ finalCode.cpp
$ ./a.out
```
